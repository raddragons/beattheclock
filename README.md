**Game Plan - “Beat the Clock, Battle Against Time, Time Crunch”**

  Main Mechanics: 
    - In game time will go down when you decide to use it for something
    - While you’re deciding what to do, time is decreasing still (but at a slower rate)
    - Get time as a reward for defeating a boss
    - Player spawns directly into boss room when their prep time runs out
    - Time does not reset when you go to fight the boss
    - Hour hand dagger, minute hand sword, hourglass hammer, ball-and-chain pocket watch
    - Grandfather clock boss that gets better each battle

  Nice-to-have Mechanics (if we finish the main mechanics):
    - Developing skills more reduces the time it takes to perform the skill
    - Side rooms to gather more skills
    - MC gets older each battle

          - Choose between helping people or buying weapons
      - Random generation?
