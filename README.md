# beattheclock
This is the repository for our LionJam 2024 game.

## **Game Plan**	
### <br>Exposition:
	You are the sole defender of an isolated town. 
	At evenly-spaced intervals, the Grandfather Clock attacks.
	You must stave him off for as long as possible, upgrading your weapons whenever possible.
	Will you be able to beat the clock and save the town for good?  
### Main Mechanics:
	You get X amount of time; you must balance it between battle prep and boss fighting
    		Your time does not reset when you go to fight the boss
	In-game time will go down by Y amount when you forge a weapon
 	The more powerful the weapon, the more in-game time you lose
	You will lose any time spent idle/deciding, but at a slower rate (in-game time is not 1:1 with real time)
	If you do not defeat the boss within the X amount of time, you lose
	If you defeat the boss with any time to spare, you will receive //some sort of bonus//
	
	Weapon ideas:
	- Minute hand sword
	- Hourglass hammer
	- Ball-and-chain pocket watch
 	
  	Boss info:
	- Grandfather clock
	- Returns more powerful for each successive battle
### Nice-to-Have Mechanics to Discuss Further:
	Upgrading your skills more reduces the time it takes to perform the skill during battle
 		E.g. an attack that by default takes 3 seconds could be upgraded to take 1 second
  	Side-dungeons attached to the prep area
   	MC gets older each battle
    	Random generation of side-dungeons?

## **Preliminary Brainstorming**
  ### Visual novel
  	3 minutes to find the criminal
   	Single playthrough type of game 
  ### Roguelite
  	Binding of Isaac/Moonlighter style
  ### 2D Platformer
  	3 minutes mechanic to increase difficulty level of the game
   	"Bomb diffusing"
    	Every 3 minutes, a platform explodes
     	Collecting time to prevent platforms from exploding 
  ### Top-down dungeon style
  	Time as currency
   		Beast comes to attack a town at even intervals, you must continue defending the town
    		Budget your time in order to get past a certain point
     		Time merchants that produce your weapons and present sidequests
      		Choose between helping people or buying weapons
       	Super hot
		When youâ€™re not moving, time is slow
 	Super speed
  		For 3 minutes, you have a power that has to do with time
